Exemption No. 11467B
Regulatory Docket No. FAA–2015–0261
Mr. Jeffrey J. Antonelli
Attorney for Aerial Inspection Resources, Inc.
Antonelli Law
35 East Wacker Drive, Suite 1875
Chicago, IL 60601
Dear Mr. Antonelli:
This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists the revised conditions and limitations.
By letter dated June 9, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Aerial Inspection Resources, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c),
61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. You requested an amendment to add the DJI S800, DJI S900, and AIR Ready
Copter UAS. In the October 16, 2015 decision letter, the FAA was unable to approve the AIR
Ready Copter UAS. The FAA is now prepared to act on that request.
The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
Airworthiness Certification
In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112−95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA

2
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H—Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.
Our Decision
The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11467A
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.
The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.
Conditions and Limitations
All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11467A remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.
Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.
1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI S1000, DJI
S900, DJI S800, and AIR Ready Copter when weighing less than 55 pounds including
payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
petition to amend this exemption.
This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.
Sincerely,
/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service
